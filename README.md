Analyze IoT Sensor Data With Machine Learning
Project Description:
<p>In this project, I have built a model for sensor data using Auto AI and build a web application that is integrated to the model built. I have used temperature, wind and humidity as input parameters and rainfall has predicted on the basis of input features. XGB Binary classifier has used to deploy the model. The accuracy of the model is 94.5%.  Node-red is used to create a web application. The simulated sensor data coming from the IoT platform is displayed on the Web Application. These simulated values have been used to predict the rainfall.
